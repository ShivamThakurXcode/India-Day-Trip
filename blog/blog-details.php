                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The Taj Mahal, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, attracts millions of visitors annually. Located in Agra, India, this magnificent marble mausoleum was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. To make the most of your visit, timing is crucial. This guide will help you choose the best time to visit the Taj Mahal.</p>

                <h3>Best Seasons to Visit</h3>
                <h4>Winter (October to March)</h4>
                <p>Winter is considered the best time to visit the Taj Mahal. The weather is pleasant with temperatures ranging from 5°C to 25°C. The clear skies provide excellent visibility for photography, and the crowds are relatively smaller compared to peak seasons.</p>

                <h4>Summer (April to June)</h4>
                <p>Summer months are extremely hot with temperatures soaring up to 45°C. While the Taj Mahal looks stunning in the bright sunlight, the heat can be overwhelming. This is the off-season, so you\'ll find fewer crowds but may need to take precautions against the heat.</p>

                <h4>Monsoon (July to September)</h4>
                <p>The monsoon season brings relief from the summer heat but also heavy rainfall. The Taj Mahal appears even more beautiful during this time as the marble reflects the water droplets. However, the humidity and occasional flooding can make exploration difficult.</p>

                <h3>Peak vs. Off-Peak Times</h3>
                <p>Peak season runs from October to March, especially during weekends and holidays. Expect larger crowds and higher accommodation prices. Off-peak times (April to June) offer a more relaxed experience with fewer tourists.</p>

                <h3>Special Events and Festivals</h3>
                <p>The Taj Mahal hosts special light shows during full moon nights and festivals like Diwali. The monument is illuminated beautifully during these events, creating a magical atmosphere.</p>

                <h3>Tips for Visiting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Book tickets in advance, especially during peak season</li>
                    <li>Visit early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid crowds</li>
                    <li>Wear comfortable shoes as there\'s a lot of walking</li>
                    <li>Hire a guide for deeper insights into the history</li>
                    <li>Respect the dress code and maintain silence in the mausoleum</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Whether you choose to visit during the cool winter months or the serene monsoon season, the Taj Mahal never fails to impress. Plan your visit according to your preferences for weather and crowds to create unforgettable memories.</p>
